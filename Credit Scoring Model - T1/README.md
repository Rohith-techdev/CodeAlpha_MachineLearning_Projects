___________________________________________________________________________

## Project Overview:

  This project implements a credit risk prediction system using Logistic Regression, a linear classification algorithm, to assess whether a loan applicant represents a low-risk or high-risk borrower. The model emphasizes interpretability, stability, and explainability, which are critical in financial applications.

## Problem Statement:

Accurately predicting credit risk is essential for minimizing loan defaults. Traditional manual evaluation methods are inefficient and prone to bias. This project applies machine learning–based risk modeling to automate and improve the credit assessment process.

## Methodology:

  1.    Performed data preprocessing, including missing value handling and categorical feature encoding using Label Encoding

  2.    Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand feature distributions and relationships

  3.    Applied feature engineering to derive meaningful financial indicators

  4.    Trained multiple models and selected Logistic Regression based on evaluation metrics and model interpretability

  5.    Evaluated model performance using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC

## Results & Interpretation:

The Logistic Regression model produced consistent and reliable predictions, making it suitable for credit risk assessment.
Key financial attributes such as credit amount, loan duration, age, and account status showed strong influence on the model’s predictions.
