# Disease Prediction using Machine Learning
-----

## Project Overview
  * Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death worldwide.
 * This project focuses on predicting the presence of heart disease in patients using machine learning classification algorithms based on clinical and demographic data.
----
## Objective

* To build and compare multiple machine learning models that can accurately classify whether a patient has heart disease.
-----
## Dataset
